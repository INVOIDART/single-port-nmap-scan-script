 
How to use:

Save the script: Save the code above as a .sh file (e.g., nmap_scan.sh).
Make it executable: chmod +x nmap_scan.sh
Run the script: ./nmap_scan.sh
Explanation:

select_options() function:
Displays a menu of Nmap options.
Takes user input and uses a case statement to set the OPTIONS variable based on the choice.
Handles invalid input by calling itself recursively.
IP Address Input and Validation:
Prompts the user to enter the target IP address.
Performs a basic regular expression check to validate the IP address format. More robust IP validation is possible but this will catch common errors.
Nmap Command Construction:
Builds the NMAP_COMMAND string by combining nmap, the selected OPTIONS, and the TARGET_IP.
Confirmation:
Displays the complete Nmap command and asks for confirmation before executing it.
Execution:
If the user confirms, the script uses eval to execute the NMAP_COMMAND. Be very careful with eval and make sure you understand the command being run. In this case, it's constructed from user-selected options, so it's reasonably safe, but always double-check.
Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for invalid IP addresses and invalid menu choices.
Port Range: -p- scans all ports (0-65535).
Common Options:
-sV: Service version detection.
-sC: Runs default Nmap scripts.
-A: Aggressive scan (includes service version detection, script scanning, and traceroute).
-sS: SYN scan (stealth scan).
Important Security Considerations:

 
eval: Be extremely cautious when using eval. It executes a string as a command. In this script, the command is built from user-selected options, which makes it somewhat safer, but it's still good practice to be aware of the risks. Avoid using eval if there's any way to do so.
Nmap Output: Nmap scans can generate a lot of output. Consider redirecting the output to a file for later analysis: nmap $OPTIONS $TARGET_IP > scan_results.txt
Further Improvements:

More robust IP validation: Use a dedicated IP address validation function or library.
More Nmap options: Add more options to the menu.
Output parsing: Parse the Nmap output and display it in a more user-friendly format.
Error handling: Add more comprehensive error handling.
Alternative to eval: If possible, refactor the script to avoid using eval by directly calling nmap with the constructed arguments. This is generally safer. For example, you could build an array of arguments and then use nmap "${arguments[@]}".
This improved script provides a more user-friendly way to select Nmap options and scan all ports of a single IP address while also addressing security considerations.  Remember to use it responsibly and ethically.
